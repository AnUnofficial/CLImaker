# CLImaker
makes simple (i.e. no subcommands) CLIs that runs python scripts

# How to run

Make your python scripts, then put them in a folder. 
Once you're done, run newcli.py and give the name and directory.
(The directory must be forward slashes and have one at the end.)

It will automatically create <name>_cli.py in the folder you ran it.

Enjoy :))
